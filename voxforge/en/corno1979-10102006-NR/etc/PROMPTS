cc001 Well, here's a story for you: Sarah Perry was a veterinary nurse
cc002 who had been working daily at an old zoo in a deserted district of the territory,
cc003 so she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice
cc004 in north square near the Duke Street Tower.
cc005 That area was much nearer for her and more to her liking.
cc006 Even so, on her first morning, she felt stressed.
cc007 She ate a bowl of porridge, checked herself in the mirror
cc008 and washed her face in a hurry. Then she put on a plain yellow dress 
cc009 and a fleece jacket, picked up her kit and headed for work.
cc010 When she got there, there was a woman with a goose waiting for her.
cc011 The woman gave Sarah an official letter from the vet.
cc012 The letter implied that the animal could be suffering from a rare form
cc013 of foot and mouth disease, which was surprising,
cc014  because normally you would only expect to see it in a dog or a goat.
cc015 Sarah was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful bird.
cc016 Before long, that itchy goose began to strut around the office like a lunatic,
cc017 which made an unsanitary mess.
cc018 The goose's owner, Mary Harrison, kept calling, "Comma, Comma,"
cc019 which Sarah thought was an odd choice for a name.
cc020 Comma was strong and huge, so it would take some force to trap her,
cc021 but Sarah had a different idea.
cc022 First she tried gently stroking the goose's lower back with her palm,
cc023 then singing a tune to her. Finally, she administered ether.
cc024  Her efforts were not futile. In no time, the goose began to tire,
cc025  so Sarah was able to hold onto Comma and give her a relaxing bath.
cc026 Once Sarah had managed to bathe the goose, she wiped her off with a cloth
cc027 and laid her on her right side. Then Sarah confirmed the vet's diagnosis.
cc028 Almost immediately, she remembered an effective treatment
cc029 that required her to measure out a lot of medicine.
cc030 Sarah warned that this course of treatment might be expensive -
cc031 either five or six times the cost of penicillin.
cc032 I can't imagine paying so much, but Mrs. Harrison - a millionaire lawyer -
cc033 thought it was a fair price for a cure.
