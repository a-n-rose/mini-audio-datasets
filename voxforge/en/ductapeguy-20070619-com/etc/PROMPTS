ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0008 HUNDRED A D LITTLE IS KNOWN BEFORE CHRIST
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0009 A RACE OF MEN INHABITED IRELAND HOWEVER
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0010 WHO HAD THEIR OWN LITERATURE AND WHO WERE ADVANCED IN THE ARTS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0011 THIS WAS BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EARLY MASS WHISKERS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0012 AND PRIOR TO THE DAYS WHEN THE ORANGEMEN HAD SENT FORTH THEIR DEFIANT PEAL
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0013 ILLUSTRATION EARLY MASS WHISKERS IN THE FIFTH CENTURY IRELAND WAS CONVERTED BY ST PATRICK
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0014 AND SHE BECAME KNOWN AS THE ISLAND OF SAINTS AND SCHOLARS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0015 TO SAY THAT SHE HAS BECOME THE ISLAND OF PUGILISTS AND POLICEMEN TO DAY WOULD BE UNJUST
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0016 AND TO SAY THAT SHE HAS MORE INFLUENCE IN AMERICA
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0017 THAN IN IRELAND WOULD BE UNKIND SURELY HER MODERN HISTORY IS MOST PATHETIC
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0018 FOR THREE CENTURIES THE ISLAND WAS HARASSED BY THE DANES AND NORTHMEN BUT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0019 WHEN THE MARQUIS OF QUEENSBERRY RULES WERE ADOPTED
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0020 THE LATTER THREW UP THE SPONGE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0021 THE FINISH FIGHT OCCURRED AT CLONTARF NEAR DUBLIN
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0022 HENRY HAD WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE POPE TO CONQUER IRELAND YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE HE CARED TO DO IT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0023 SOMETIMES IT RAINED AND AT OTHER TIMES HE DID NOT FEEL LIKE IT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0024 SO THAT HIS PERMISSION GOT ALMOST WORN OUT BY CARRYING IT ABOUT WITH HIM
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0025 IN ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO HOWEVER AN IRISH CHIEF
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0026 OR SUBORDINATE KING HAD TROUBLE WITH HIS KINGDOM
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0027 DOUBTLESS BECAUSE SOME RIVAL MONARCH STEPPED IN IT AND TRACKED IT AROUND OVER THE OTHER KINGDOMS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0028 AND SO HE CALLED UPON THE ANGLO NORMANS UNDER STRONGBOW
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0029 RICHARD DE CLARE WHOSE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0030 WAS THE FIRST THING OF THE KIND KNOWN TO CIVILIZATION FOR HELP

ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0032 AND ACTING UPON IT PROCEEDED TO GATHER IN THE OTHER PRECINCTS OF IRELAND
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0033 THUS IN ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO THE ISLAND WAS PLACED UNDER THE RULE OF A VICEROY SENT THERE BY ENGLAND
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0034 HENRY NOW HAD TROUBLE WITH THREE OF HIS SONS

ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0036 THEY WOULD GO TO PARIS AND GO INTO THE ROUE BUSINESS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0037 HENRY HIMSELF WAS GREATLY TALKED ABOUT AND HIS NAME COUPLED WITH THAT OF FAIR ROSAMOND CLIFFORD
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0038 A RIVAL OF QUEEN ELEANOR THE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0039 KING REFUSED TO GRANT THE REQUEST OF HIS SONS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0040 AND BADE THEM GO AHEAD WITH THEIR ROUE ENTERPRISES
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0041 SO LONG AS THEY DID NOT ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH HIM
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0042 ILLUSTRATION THE BECKET DIFFICULTY STILL KEPT HENRY AWAKE AT NIGHT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0043 SO THEY WENT TO PARIS WHERE THEIR CUTTINGS UP WERE NOT NOTICED
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0044 THE QUEEN TOOK THEIR SIDE AS ALSO DID LOUIS OF FRANCE AND WILLIAM KING OF SCOTLAND
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0045 WITH THE BECKET DIFFICULTY STILL KEEPING HIM AWAKE OF NIGHTS ALSO
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0046 THE KING WAS IN CONSTANT HOT WATER
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0047 AND FOR A TIME IT SEEMED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO SEEK OTHER EMPLOYMENT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0048 BUT HIS MASTERLY HIT IN MAKING A BAREFOOTED PILGRIMAGE TO THE TOMB OF

ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0058 HENRY JR DIED REPENTANT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0059 BUT GEOFFREY PERISHED IN HIS SINS IN A TOURNAMENT ALTHOUGH GENERALLY THE TOURNAMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CONDUCIVE TO LONGEVITY
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0060 RICHARD WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY A REBEL AND AT LAST COMPELLED THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0061 YIELD TO A HUMILIATING TREATY WITH THE FRENCH IN ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0062 FINDING IN THE LIST OF THE OPPOSING FORCES THE NAME OF JOHN HIS YOUNG FAVORITE SON
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0063 THE POOR OLD BATTERED MONARCH IN ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0064 SELECTED AN UNOCCUPIED GRAVE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF SAME
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0065 ILLUSTRATION THE UNHAPPY FATHER SANK INTO THE GRAVE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0066 HE CURSED HIS SONS AND DIED MISERABLY DESERTED BY HIS FOLLOWERS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0067 WHO TOOK SUCH CLOTHING AS FITTED THEM BEST AND WOULD HAVE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0068 PAWNED THE THRONE HAD IT NOT BEEN OUT OF STYLE AND UNAVAILABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE

ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0071 HIS PRIVATE LIFE SEEMED TO CALL LOUDLY FOR A GOOD COMPETENT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0072 DISINFECTANT ILLUSTRATION WHEN RICHARD WAS SICK THE GENEROUS SULTAN SENT HIM FRUITS AND ICE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0073 RICHARD KYUR DUH LEONG AS THE FRENCH HAVE IT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0074 OR RICHARD I OF THE LION HEART
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0075 REIGNED IN HIS FATHER'S STEAD FROM ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE

ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0078 HIS INAUGURAL BALL WERE INSULTED BY THE POPULACE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0079 WHO BELIEVED THAT THE KING FAVORED A MASSACRE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0080 AND SO MANY WERE PUT TO DEATH
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0081 RICHARD AND PHILIP OF FRANCE ORGANIZED A SUCCESSFUL CRUSADE AGAINST PEOPLE

ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0083 WHERE THE WOODS WERE FULL OF INFIDELS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0084 RICHARD HOWEVER WAS SO OVERBEARING THAT PHILIP COULD NOT GET ALONG WITH HIM
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0085 AND THEY DISSOLVED PARTNERSHIP BUT RICHARD CAPTURED ASCALON AFTER THIS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0086 HIS ARMY WAS TOO MUCH REDUCED HOWEVER TO CAPTURE JERUSALEM
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0087 SALADIN THE OPPOSING SULTAN WAS A GREAT ADMIRER
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0088 OF RICHARD AND WHEN THE LION HEARTED KING WAS ILL SENT HIM FRUITS AND EVEN ICE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0089 SO THE HISTORIAN SAYS WHERE THE SARACENS GOT THEIR ICE AT THAT TIME
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0090 WE CAN ONLY SURMISE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0091 PEACE WAS ESTABLISHED AND THE PILGRIMS WHO DESIRED TO ENTER THE HOLY CITY

ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0108 WHEN ONE READS OF THE BRIEF LIVES OF THESE OLD REIGNERS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0109 FOR IT SURELY DEMONSTRATES THAT ROYALTY
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0110 WHEN NOT CARRIED TO EXCESS IS RATHER CONDUCIVE TO HEALTH THAN OTHERWISE

ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0112 EXCEPT THE YOUNG WARRIOR WHO HAD GIVEN HIM HIS DEATH WOUND
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0113 DOUBTLESS THIS WAS DONE TO ENCOURAGE GOOD MARKSMANSHIP
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0114 ENGLAND GOT NO BENEFIT FROM RICHARD'S GREAT DARING AND EXPENSIVE PICNICS IN PALESTINE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0115 BUT OF COURSE HE ADVERTISED GREAT BRITAIN AND FRIGHTENED FOREIGN POWERS CONSIDERABLY
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0116 THE TAXATION NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AN ARMY IN THE HOLY LAND WHERE BOARD WAS HIGH KEPT ENGLAND POOR
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0117 BUT EVERY ONE WAS PROUD OF RICHARD
ductapeguy-20070619-com/mfc/com0118 BECAUSE HE FEARED NOT THE FACE OF CLAY
