com0006 ANCIENTLY CALLED HIBERNIA THESE PEOPLE WERE SIMILAR TO THE BRITONS 
com0007 BUT OF THEIR HISTORY PRIOR TO THE YEAR FOUR 
com0008 HUNDRED A D LITTLE IS KNOWN BEFORE CHRIST 
com0009 A RACE OF MEN INHABITED IRELAND HOWEVER 
com0010 WHO HAD THEIR OWN LITERATURE AND WHO WERE ADVANCED IN THE ARTS 
com0011 THIS WAS BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EARLY MASS WHISKERS

com0013 ILLUSTRATION EARLY MASS WHISKERS IN THE FIFTH CENTURY IRELAND WAS CONVERTED BY ST PATRICK 
com0014 AND SHE BECAME KNOWN AS THE ISLAND OF SAINTS AND SCHOLARS 
com0015 TO SAY THAT SHE HAS BECOME THE ISLAND OF PUGILISTS AND POLICEMEN TO DAY WOULD BE UNJUST 
com0016 AND TO SAY THAT SHE HAS MORE INFLUENCE IN AMERICA 
com0017 THAN IN IRELAND WOULD BE UNKIND SURELY HER MODERN HISTORY IS MOST PATHETIC

com0025 IN ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO HOWEVER AN IRISH CHIEF 
com0026 OR SUBORDINATE KING HAD TROUBLE WITH HIS KINGDOM 
com0027 DOUBTLESS BECAUSE SOME RIVAL MONARCH STEPPED IN IT AND TRACKED IT AROUND OVER THE OTHER KINGDOMS 
com0028 AND SO HE CALLED UPON THE ANGLO NORMANS UNDER STRONGBOW 
com0029 RICHARD DE CLARE WHOSE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE 
com0030 WAS THE FIRST THING OF THE KIND KNOWN TO CIVILIZATION FOR HELP 
com0031 WHILE ASSISTING THE IRISH CHIEF STRONGBOW NOTICED A ROYAL WINK ON THE FEATURES OF HENRY 
com0032 AND ACTING UPON IT PROCEEDED TO GATHER IN THE OTHER PRECINCTS OF IRELAND 
com0033 THUS IN ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO THE ISLAND WAS PLACED UNDER THE RULE OF A VICEROY SENT THERE BY ENGLAND 
com0034 HENRY NOW HAD TROUBLE WITH THREE OF HIS SONS 
com0035 HENRY RICHARD AND GEOFFREY WHO THREATENED THAT IF THE OLD GENTLEMAN DID NOT DIVIDE UP HIS KINGDOM AMONG THEM 
com0036 THEY WOULD GO TO PARIS AND GO INTO THE ROUE BUSINESS 
com0037 HENRY HIMSELF WAS GREATLY TALKED ABOUT AND HIS NAME COUPLED WITH THAT OF FAIR ROSAMOND CLIFFORD 
com0038 A RIVAL OF QUEEN ELEANOR THE 
com0039 KING REFUSED TO GRANT THE REQUEST OF HIS SONS

com0049 BECKET THUS SECURING ABSOLUTION FROM THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY TURNED

com0053 AND ROAST BEEF WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR OATS 
com0054 IRISH AND SCOTCH WHISKEY WERE NOW INTRODUCED INTO THE NATIONAL POLICY AND BITS OF BRIGHT ENGLISH HUMOR 
com0055 WITH FOOT NOTES FOR THE USE OF THE SCOTS 
com0056 WERE SHIPPED TO EDINBURGH HENRY HAD MORE TROUBLE WITH HIS SONS HOWEVER 
com0057 AND THEY EMBITTERED HIS LIFE AS THE SONS OF A TOO FROLICSOME FATHER ARE APT TO DO 
com0058 HENRY JR DIED REPENTANT 
com0059 BUT GEOFFREY PERISHED IN HIS SINS IN A TOURNAMENT ALTHOUGH GENERALLY THE TOURNAMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CONDUCIVE TO LONGEVITY 
com0060 RICHARD WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY A REBEL AND AT LAST COMPELLED THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO 
com0061 YIELD TO A HUMILIATING TREATY WITH THE FRENCH IN ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE 
com0062 FINDING IN THE LIST OF THE OPPOSING FORCES THE NAME OF JOHN HIS YOUNG FAVORITE SON 
com0063 THE POOR OLD BATTERED MONARCH IN ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE

com0069 BESIDE BEING SECURED TO THE CASTLE

com0075 REIGNED IN HIS FATHER'S STEAD FROM ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE 
com0076 TO ELEVEN NINETY NINE HIS REIGN OPENED WITH A DISAGREEABLE MASSACRE 
com0077 THE JEWS WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM SOME PRESENTS TO WEAR AT 
com0078 HIS INAUGURAL BALL WERE INSULTED BY THE POPULACE 
com0079 WHO BELIEVED THAT THE KING FAVORED A MASSACRE 
com0080 AND SO MANY WERE PUT TO DEATH 
com0081 RICHARD AND PHILIP OF FRANCE ORGANIZED A SUCCESSFUL CRUSADE AGAINST PEOPLE 
com0082 WHO WERE NOT DEEMED ORTHODOX AND SUCCEEDED IN BAGGING A GOOD MANY IN SYRIA 
com0083 WHERE THE WOODS WERE FULL OF INFIDELS 
com0084 RICHARD HOWEVER WAS SO OVERBEARING THAT PHILIP COULD NOT GET ALONG WITH HIM 
com0085 AND THEY DISSOLVED PARTNERSHIP BUT RICHARD CAPTURED ASCALON AFTER THIS 
com0086 HIS ARMY WAS TOO MUCH REDUCED HOWEVER TO CAPTURE JERUSALEM 
com0087 SALADIN THE OPPOSING SULTAN WAS A GREAT ADMIRER 
com0088 OF RICHARD AND WHEN THE LION HEARTED KING WAS ILL SENT HIM FRUITS AND EVEN ICE 
com0089 SO THE HISTORIAN SAYS WHERE THE SARACENS GOT THEIR ICE AT THAT TIME 
com0090 WE CAN ONLY SURMISE 
com0091 PEACE WAS ESTABLISHED AND THE PILGRIMS WHO DESIRED TO ENTER THE HOLY CITY 
com0092 WERE UNMOLESTED THIS MATTER WAS SETTLED IN ELEVEN NINETY TWO 
com0093 ON HIS RETURN RICHARD WAS COMPELLED TO GO INCOG THROUGH GERMANY 
com0094 AS THE AUTHORITIES WERE OPPOSED TO HIM 
com0095 HE WAS DISCOVERED AND CONFINED TILL A LARGE RANSOM WAS PAID 
com0096 PHILIP AND JOHN THE KING'S BROTHER DECIDED THAT RICHARD'S EXTREMITY WAS THEIR OPPORTUNITY 
com0097 AND SO CONCLUDED TO DIVIDE UP HIS KINGDOM BETWEEN THEM 
com0098 AT THIS DRAMATIC MOMENT RICHARD 
com0099 HAVING PAID HIS SIXTY THOUSAND POUNDS RANSOM AND TIPPED HIS CUSTODIAN 
com0100 ENTERED THE ENGLISH ARENA AND THE JIG WAS UP 
com0101 JOHN WAS OBLIGED TO ASK PARDON AND RICHARD GENEROUSLY 
com0102 GAVE IT WITH THE EXCLAMATION 
com0103 OH THAT I COULD FORGET HIS INJURIES AS SOON AS HE WILL MY FORGIVENESS 
com0104 ILLUSTRATION RICHARD TRAVELLING INCOG THROUGH GERMANY RICHARD NEVER SECURED A PEACE WITH PHILIP 
com0105 BUT DIED IN ELEVEN NINETY NINE FROM THE EFFECTS OF A WOUND 
com0106 RECEIVED IN FRANCE AND WHEN BUT FORTY TWO YEARS OF AGE 
com0107 THE LONGEVITY AMONG MONARCHS OF THE PRESENT DAY IS INDEED GRATIFYING 
com0108 WHEN ONE READS OF THE BRIEF LIVES OF THESE OLD REIGNERS 
com0109 FOR IT SURELY DEMONSTRATES THAT ROYALTY 
com0110 WHEN NOT CARRIED TO EXCESS IS RATHER CONDUCIVE TO HEALTH THAN OTHERWISE 
com0111 RICHARD DIED FROM THE EFFECTS OF AN ARROW WOUND AND ALL HIS FOES IN THIS ENGAGEMENT WERE HANGED 
com0112 EXCEPT THE YOUNG WARRIOR WHO HAD GIVEN HIM HIS DEATH WOUND 
com0113 DOUBTLESS THIS WAS DONE TO ENCOURAGE GOOD MARKSMANSHIP 
com0114 ENGLAND GOT NO BENEFIT FROM RICHARD'S GREAT DARING AND EXPENSIVE PICNICS IN PALESTINE 
com0115 BUT OF COURSE HE ADVERTISED GREAT BRITAIN AND FRIGHTENED FOREIGN POWERS CONSIDERABLY 
com0116 THE TAXATION NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AN ARMY IN THE HOLY LAND WHERE BOARD WAS HIGH KEPT ENGLAND POOR 
com0117 BUT EVERY ONE WAS PROUD OF RICHARD 
com0118 BECAUSE HE FEARED NOT THE FACE OF CLAY 
com0119 JOHN THE DISAGREEABLE BROTHER SUCCEEDED RICHARD AND REIGNED SEVENTEEN YEARS 
com0120 THOUGH HIS NEPHEW ARTHUR THE SON OF GEOFFREY WAS THE RIGHTFUL HEIR 
com0121 PHILIP WHO KEPT HIMSELF IN POCKET MONEY BY STARTING ONE HORSE REBELLIONS AGAINST ENGLAND 
com0122 JOINED WITH ARTHUR LONG ENOUGH TO EFFECT A TREATY IN TWELVE HUNDRED 
com0123 WHICH KEPT HIM IN GROCERIES SEVERAL YEARS 
com0124 WHEN HE AGAIN BROUGHT PRINCE ARTHUR FORWARD BUT THIS WAS DISASTROUS 
com0125 FOR THE YOUNG PRINCE WAS CAPTURED AND CRUELLY ASSASSINATED BY REQUEST OF HIS AFFECTIONATE UNCLE 
com0126 KING JOHN TO BE A RELATIVE OF THE KING IN THOSE 
com0127 GOOD OLD DAYS WAS GENERALLY FATAL  
com0128 LET US REJOICE THAT TIMES HAVE SO GREATLY IMPROVED 
com0129 AND THAT THE WICKED MONARCH HAS LEARNED TO SEAT HIMSELF GINGERLY UPON HIS BOMB INFESTED THRONE
