kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0005 HE WAS NOT MR WENTWORTH THE FORMER CURATE OF MONKFORD
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0006 HOWEVER SUSPICIOUS APPEARANCES MAY BE BUT A CAPTAIN FREDERICK WENTWORTH HIS BROTHER WHO
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0007 BEING MADE COMMANDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACTION OFF ST DOMINGO
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0008 AND NOT IMMEDIATELY EMPLOYED HAD COME INTO SOMERSETSHIRE IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN OH SIX
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0009 AND HAVING NO PARENT LIVING FOUND A HOME FOR HALF A YEAR AT MONKFORD
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0010 HE WAS AT THAT TIME A REMARKABLY FINE YOUNG MAN
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0011 WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INTELLIGENCE SPIRIT AND BRILLIANCY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0012 AND ANNE AN EXTREMELY PRETTY GIRL WITH GENTLENESS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0013 MODESTY TASTE AND FEELING
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0014 HALF THE SUM OF ATTRACTION ON EITHER SIDE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0015 FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO DO AND SHE HAD HARDLY ANYBODY TO LOVE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0016 BUT THE ENCOUNTER OF SUCH LAVISH RECOMMENDATIONS COULD NOT FAIL
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0017 THEY WERE GRADUALLY ACQUAINTED AND WHEN ACQUAINTED RAPIDLY AND DEEPLY IN LOVE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0018 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH HAD SEEN HIGHEST PERFECTION IN THE OTHER
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0019 OR WHICH HAD BEEN THE HAPPIEST SHE IN RECEIVING HIS DECLARATIONS AND PROPOSALS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0020 OR HE IN HAVING THEM ACCEPTED A SHORT PERIOD OF EXQUISITE FELICITY FOLLOWED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0021 AND BUT A SHORT ONE TROUBLES SOON AROSE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0022 SIR WALTER ON BEING APPLIED TO WITHOUT ACTUALLY WITHHOLDING HIS CONSENT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0023 OR SAYING IT SHOULD NEVER BE GAVE IT ALL THE NEGATIVE OF GREAT ASTONISHMENT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0024 GREAT COLDNESS GREAT SILENCE AND A PROFESSED RESOLUTION OF DOING NOTHING FOR HIS DAUGHTER
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0025 HE THOUGHT IT A VERY DEGRADING ALLIANCE AND LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0026 THOUGH WITH MORE TEMPERED AND PARDONABLE PRIDE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0027 RECEIVED IT AS A MOST UNFORTUNATE ONE ANNE ELLIOT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0028 WITH ALL HER CLAIMS OF BIRTH BEAUTY AND MIND
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0029 TO THROW HERSELF AWAY AT NINETEEN
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0030 INVOLVE HERSELF AT NINETEEN IN AN ENGAGEMENT WITH A YOUNG MAN
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0031 WHO HAD NOTHING BUT HIMSELF TO RECOMMEND HIM
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0032 AND NO HOPES OF ATTAINING AFFLUENCE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0033 BUT IN THE CHANCES OF A MOST UNCERTAIN PROFESSION
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0034 AND NO CONNEXIONS TO SECURE EVEN HIS FARTHER RISE IN THE PROFESSION
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0035 WOULD BE INDEED A THROWING AWAY WHICH SHE GRIEVED TO THINK OF
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0036 ANNE ELLIOT SO YOUNG
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0037 KNOWN TO SO FEW TO BE SNATCHED OFF BY A STRANGER WITHOUT ALLIANCE OR FORTUNE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0038 OR RATHER SUNK BY HIM INTO A STATE OF MOST WEARING ANXIOUS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0039 YOUTH KILLING DEPENDENCE IT MUST NOT BE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0040 IF BY ANY FAIR INTERFERENCE OF FRIENDSHIP
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0041 ANY REPRESENTATIONS FROM ONE WHO HAD ALMOST A MOTHER'S LOVE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0042 AND MOTHER'S RIGHTS IT WOULD BE PREVENTED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD NO FORTUNE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0043 HE HAD BEEN LUCKY IN HIS PROFESSION
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0044 BUT SPENDING FREELY WHAT HAD COME FREELY HAD REALIZED NOTHING
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0045 BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SOON BE RICH
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0046 FULL OF LIFE AND ARDOUR HE KNEW THAT HE SHOULD SOON HAVE A SHIP
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0047 AND SOON BE ON A STATION THAT WOULD LEAD TO EVERYTHING HE WANTED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0048 HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN LUCKY HE KNEW HE SHOULD BE SO STILL
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0049 SUCH CONFIDENCE POWERFUL IN ITS OWN WARMTH AND BEWITCHING
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0050 IN THE WIT WHICH OFTEN EXPRESSED IT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0051 MUST HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR ANNE BUT LADY RUSSELL SAW IT VERY DIFFERENTLY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0052 HIS SANGUINE TEMPER AND FEARLESSNESS OF MIND OPERATED VERY DIFFERENTLY ON HER
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0053 SHE SAW IN IT BUT AN AGGRAVATION OF THE EVIL
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0054 IT ONLY ADDED A DANGEROUS CHARACTER TO HIMSELF HE WAS BRILLIANT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0055 HE WAS HEADSTRONG LADY RUSSELL HAD LITTLE TASTE FOR WIT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0056 AND OF ANYTHING APPROACHING TO IMPRUDENCE A HORROR
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0057 SHE DEPRECATED THE CONNEXION IN EVERY LIGHT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0058 SUCH OPPOSITION AS THESE FEELINGS PRODUCED WAS MORE THAN ANNE COULD COMBAT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0059 YOUNG AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0060 IT MIGHT YET HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO WITHSTAND HER FATHER'S ILL WILL
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0061 THOUGH UNSOFTENED BY ONE KIND WORD OR LOOK ON THE PART OF HER SISTER
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0062 BUT LADY RUSSELL WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND RELIED ON COULD NOT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0063 WITH SUCH STEADINESS OF OPINION AND SUCH TENDERNESS OF MANNER
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0064 BE CONTINUALLY ADVISING HER IN VAIN
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0065 SHE WAS PERSUADED TO BELIEVE THE ENGAGEMENT A WRONG THING
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0066 INDISCREET IMPROPER HARDLY CAPABLE OF SUCCESS AND NOT DESERVING IT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0067 BUT IT WAS NOT A MERELY SELFISH CAUTION UNDER WHICH SHE ACTED IN PUTTING AN END TO IT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0068 HAD SHE NOT IMAGINED HERSELF CONSULTING HIS GOOD
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0069 EVEN MORE THAN HER OWN SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM UP
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0070 THE BELIEF OF BEING PRUDENT AND SELF DENYING
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0071 PRINCIPALLY FOR HIS ADVANTAGE WAS HER CHIEF CONSOLATION
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0072 UNDER THE MISERY OF A PARTING A FINAL PARTING
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0073 AND EVERY CONSOLATION WAS REQUIRED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0074 FOR SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER ALL THE ADDITIONAL PAIN OF OPINIONS ON HIS SIDE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0075 TOTALLY UNCONVINCED AND UNBENDING AND OF HIS FEELING HIMSELF ILL USED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0076 BY SO FORCED A RELINQUISHMENT HE HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY IN CONSEQUENCE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0077 A FEW MONTHS HAD SEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0078 BUT NOT WITH A FEW MONTHS ENDED ANNE'S SHARE OF SUFFERING FROM IT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0079 HER ATTACHMENT AND REGRETS HAD FOR A LONG TIME
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0080 CLOUDED EVERY ENJOYMENT OF YOUTH
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0081 AND AN EARLY LOSS OF BLOOM AND SPIRITS HAD BEEN THEIR LASTING EFFECT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0082 MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS WERE GONE SINCE THIS LITTLE HISTORY OF SORROWFUL INTEREST HAD REACHED ITS CLOSE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0083 AND TIME HAD SOFTENED DOWN MUCH PERHAPS NEARLY ALL OF PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HIM
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0084 BUT SHE HAD BEEN TOO DEPENDENT ON TIME ALONE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0085 NO AID HAD BEEN GIVEN IN CHANGE OF PLACE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0086 EXCEPT IN ONE VISIT TO BATH SOON AFTER THE RUPTURE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0087 OR IN ANY NOVELTY OR ENLARGEMENT OF SOCIETY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0088 NO ONE HAD EVER COME WITHIN THE KELLYNCH CIRCLE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0089 WHO COULD BEAR A COMPARISON WITH FREDERICK WENTWORTH
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0090 AS HE STOOD IN HER MEMORY NO SECOND ATTACHMENT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0091 THE ONLY THOROUGHLY NATURAL HAPPY AND SUFFICIENT CURE AT HER TIME OF LIFE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0092 HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO THE NICE TONE OF HER MIND
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0093 THE FASTIDIOUSNESS OF HER TASTE IN THE SMALL LIMITS OF THE SOCIETY AROUND THEM
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0094 SHE HAD BEEN SOLICITED WHEN ABOUT TWO AND TWENTY TO CHANGE HER NAME BY THE YOUNG MAN
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0095 WHO NOT LONG AFTERWARDS FOUND A MORE WILLING MIND IN HER YOUNGER SISTER
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0096 AND LADY RUSSELL HAD LAMENTED HER REFUSAL
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0097 FOR CHARLES MUSGROVE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A MAN WHOSE LANDED PROPERTY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0098 AND GENERAL IMPORTANCE WERE SECOND IN THAT COUNTRY ONLY TO SIR WALTER'S
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0099 AND OF GOOD CHARACTER AND APPEARANCE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0100 AND HOWEVER LADY RUSSELL MIGHT HAVE ASKED YET FOR SOMETHING MORE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0101 WHILE ANNE WAS NINETEEN
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0102 SHE WOULD HAVE REJOICED TO SEE HER AT TWENTY TWO SO RESPECTABLY REMOVED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0103 FROM THE PARTIALITIES AND INJUSTICE OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0104 AND SETTLED SO PERMANENTLY NEAR HERSELF BUT IN THIS CASE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0105 ANNE HAD LEFT NOTHING FOR ADVICE TO DO AND THOUGH LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0106 AS SATISFIED AS EVER WITH HER OWN DISCRETION
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0107 NEVER WISHED THE PAST UNDONE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0108 SHE BEGAN NOW TO HAVE THE ANXIETY WHICH BORDERS ON HOPELESSNESS FOR ANNE'S BEING TEMPTED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0109 BY SOME MAN OF TALENTS AND INDEPENDENCE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0110 TO ENTER A STATE FOR WHICH SHE HELD HER TO BE PECULIARLY FITTED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0111 BY HER WARM AFFECTIONS AND DOMESTIC HABITS THEY KNEW NOT EACH OTHER'S OPINION
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0112 EITHER ITS CONSTANCY OR ITS CHANGE ON THE ONE LEADING POINT OF ANNE'S CONDUCT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0113 FOR THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER ALLUDED TO BUT ANNE AT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0114 SEVEN AND TWENTY THOUGHT VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT SHE HAD BEEN MADE TO THINK AT NINETEEN
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0115 SHE DID NOT BLAME LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0116 SHE DID NOT BLAME HERSELF FOR HAVING BEEN GUIDED BY HER
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0117 BUT SHE FELT THAT WERE ANY YOUNG PERSON IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0118 TO APPLY TO HER FOR COUNSEL
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0119 THEY WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ANY OF SUCH CERTAIN IMMEDIATE WRETCHEDNESS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0120 SUCH UNCERTAIN FUTURE GOOD SHE WAS PERSUADED THAT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0121 UNDER EVERY DISADVANTAGE OF DISAPPROBATION AT HOME
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0122 AND EVERY ANXIETY ATTENDING HIS PROFESSION ALL THEIR PROBABLE FEARS DELAYS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0123 SHE SHOULD YET HAVE BEEN A HAPPIER WOMAN IN MAINTAINING THE ENGAGEMENT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0124 THAN SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SACRIFICE OF IT AND THIS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0125 SHE FULLY BELIEVED HAD THE USUAL SHARE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0126 HAD EVEN MORE THAN THE USUAL SHARE OF ALL SUCH SOLICITUDES AND SUSPENSE BEEN THEIRS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0127 WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF THEIR CASE WHICH
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0128 AS IT HAPPENED WOULD HAVE BESTOWED EARLIER PROSPERITY THAN COULD BE REASONABLY CALCULATED ON
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0129 ALL HIS SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS ALL HIS CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0130 HIS GENIUS AND ARDOUR HAD SEEMED TO FORESEE AND TO COMMAND HIS PROSPEROUS PATH
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0131 HE HAD VERY SOON AFTER THEIR ENGAGEMENT CEASED GOT EMPLOY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0132 AND ALL THAT HE HAD TOLD HER WOULD FOLLOW HAD TAKEN PLACE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0133 HE HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AND EARLY GAINED THE OTHER STEP IN RANK
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0134 AND MUST NOW BY SUCCESSIVE CAPTURES HAVE MADE A HANDSOME FORTUNE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0135 SHE HAD ONLY NAVY LISTS AND NEWSPAPERS FOR HER AUTHORITY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0136 BUT SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HIS BEING RICH
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0137 AND IN FAVOUR OF HIS CONSTANCY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0138 SHE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE HIM MARRIED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0139 HOW ELOQUENT COULD ANNE ELLIOT HAVE BEEN HOW ELOQUENT AT LEAST
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0140 WERE HER WISHES ON THE SIDE OF EARLY WARM ATTACHMENT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0141 AND A CHEERFUL CONFIDENCE IN FUTURITY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0142 AGAINST THAT OVER ANXIOUS CAUTION WHICH SEEMS TO INSULT EXERTION AND DISTRUST PROVIDENCE
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0143 SHE HAD BEEN FORCED INTO PRUDENCE IN HER YOUTH
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0144 SHE LEARNED ROMANCE AS SHE GREW OLDER
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0145 THE NATURAL SEQUEL OF AN UNNATURAL BEGINNING
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0146 WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RECOLLECTIONS AND FEELINGS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0147 SHE COULD NOT HEAR THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S SISTER WAS LIKELY TO LIVE AT KELLYNCH
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0148 WITHOUT A REVIVAL OF FORMER PAIN
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0149 AND MANY A STROLL AND MANY A SIGH WERE NECESSARY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0150 TO DISPEL THE AGITATION OF THE IDEA
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0151 SHE OFTEN TOLD HERSELF IT WAS FOLLY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0152 BEFORE SHE COULD HARDEN HER NERVES SUFFICIENTLY TO FEEL THE CONTINUAL DISCUSSION OF THE CROFTS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0153 AND THEIR BUSINESS NO EVIL SHE WAS ASSISTED HOWEVER
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0154 BY THAT PERFECT INDIFFERENCE AND APPARENT UNCONSCIOUSNESS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0155 AMONG THE ONLY THREE OF HER OWN FRIENDS IN THE SECRET OF THE PAST
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0156 WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO DENY ANY RECOLLECTION OF IT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0157 SHE COULD DO JUSTICE TO THE SUPERIORITY OF LADY RUSSELL'S MOTIVES IN THIS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0158 OVER THOSE OF HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0159 SHE COULD HONOUR ALL THE BETTER FEELINGS OF HER CALMNESS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0160 BUT THE GENERAL AIR OF OBLIVION AMONG THEM WAS HIGHLY IMPORTANT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0161 FROM WHATEVER IT SPRUNG AND IN THE EVENT OF ADMIRAL CROFT'S REALLY TAKING KELLYNCH HALL
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0162 SHE REJOICED ANEW OVER THE CONVICTION WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN MOST GRATEFUL TO HER
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0163 OF THE PAST BEING KNOWN TO THOSE THREE ONLY AMONG HER CONNEXIONS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0164 BY WHOM NO SYLLABLE SHE BELIEVED WOULD EVER BE WHISPERED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0165 AND IN THE TRUST THAT AMONG HIS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0166 THE BROTHER ONLY WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN RESIDING HAD RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION OF THEIR SHORT LIVED ENGAGEMENT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0167 THAT BROTHER HAD BEEN LONG REMOVED FROM THE COUNTRY
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0168 AND BEING A SENSIBLE MAN AND MOREOVER A SINGLE MAN AT THE TIME
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0169 SHE HAD A FOND DEPENDENCE ON NO HUMAN CREATURE'S HAVING HEARD OF IT FROM HIM
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0170 THE SISTER MRS CROFT
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0171 HAD THEN BEEN OUT OF ENGLAND ACCOMPANYING HER HUSBAND ON A FOREIGN STATION
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0172 AND HER OWN SISTER MARY HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL WHILE IT ALL OCCURRED
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0173 AND NEVER ADMITTED BY THE PRIDE OF SOME
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0174 AND THE DELICACY OF OTHERS TO THE SMALLEST KNOWLEDGE OF IT AFTERWARDS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0175 WITH THESE SUPPORTS SHE HOPED THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN HERSELF AND THE CROFTS
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0176 WHICH WITH LADY RUSSELL STILL RESIDENT IN KELLYNCH AND MARY FIXED ONLY THREE MILES OFF
kayray-20070425-per04/mfc/per0177 MUST BE ANTICIPATED NEED NOT INVOLVE ANY PARTICULAR AWKWARDNESS
