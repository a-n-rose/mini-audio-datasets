per0005 HE WAS NOT MR WENTWORTH THE FORMER CURATE OF MONKFORD 
per0006 HOWEVER SUSPICIOUS APPEARANCES MAY BE BUT A CAPTAIN FREDERICK WENTWORTH HIS BROTHER WHO 
per0007 BEING MADE COMMANDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACTION OFF ST DOMINGO 
per0008 AND NOT IMMEDIATELY EMPLOYED HAD COME INTO SOMERSETSHIRE IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN OH SIX 
per0009 AND HAVING NO PARENT LIVING FOUND A HOME FOR HALF A YEAR AT MONKFORD 
per0010 HE WAS AT THAT TIME A REMARKABLY FINE YOUNG MAN 
per0011 WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INTELLIGENCE SPIRIT AND BRILLIANCY 
per0012 AND ANNE AN EXTREMELY PRETTY GIRL WITH GENTLENESS 
per0013 MODESTY TASTE AND FEELING 
per0014 HALF THE SUM OF ATTRACTION ON EITHER SIDE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH 
per0015 FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO DO AND SHE HAD HARDLY ANYBODY TO LOVE 
per0016 BUT THE ENCOUNTER OF SUCH LAVISH RECOMMENDATIONS COULD NOT FAIL 
per0017 THEY WERE GRADUALLY ACQUAINTED AND WHEN ACQUAINTED RAPIDLY AND DEEPLY IN LOVE 
per0018 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH HAD SEEN HIGHEST PERFECTION IN THE OTHER 
per0019 OR WHICH HAD BEEN THE HAPPIEST SHE IN RECEIVING HIS DECLARATIONS AND PROPOSALS 
per0020 OR HE IN HAVING THEM ACCEPTED A SHORT PERIOD OF EXQUISITE FELICITY FOLLOWED 
per0021 AND BUT A SHORT ONE TROUBLES SOON AROSE 
per0022 SIR WALTER ON BEING APPLIED TO WITHOUT ACTUALLY WITHHOLDING HIS CONSENT 
per0023 OR SAYING IT SHOULD NEVER BE GAVE IT ALL THE NEGATIVE OF GREAT ASTONISHMENT 
per0024 GREAT COLDNESS GREAT SILENCE AND A PROFESSED RESOLUTION OF DOING NOTHING FOR HIS DAUGHTER 
per0025 HE THOUGHT IT A VERY DEGRADING ALLIANCE AND LADY RUSSELL 
per0026 THOUGH WITH MORE TEMPERED AND PARDONABLE PRIDE 
per0027 RECEIVED IT AS A MOST UNFORTUNATE ONE ANNE ELLIOT 
per0028 WITH ALL HER CLAIMS OF BIRTH BEAUTY AND MIND 
per0029 TO THROW HERSELF AWAY AT NINETEEN 
per0030 INVOLVE HERSELF AT NINETEEN IN AN ENGAGEMENT WITH A YOUNG MAN 
per0031 WHO HAD NOTHING BUT HIMSELF TO RECOMMEND HIM 
per0032 AND NO HOPES OF ATTAINING AFFLUENCE 
per0033 BUT IN THE CHANCES OF A MOST UNCERTAIN PROFESSION 
per0034 AND NO CONNEXIONS TO SECURE EVEN HIS FARTHER RISE IN THE PROFESSION 
per0035 WOULD BE INDEED A THROWING AWAY WHICH SHE GRIEVED TO THINK OF 
per0036 ANNE ELLIOT SO YOUNG 
per0037 KNOWN TO SO FEW TO BE SNATCHED OFF BY A STRANGER WITHOUT ALLIANCE OR FORTUNE 
per0038 OR RATHER SUNK BY HIM INTO A STATE OF MOST WEARING ANXIOUS 
per0039 YOUTH KILLING DEPENDENCE IT MUST NOT BE 
per0040 IF BY ANY FAIR INTERFERENCE OF FRIENDSHIP 
per0041 ANY REPRESENTATIONS FROM ONE WHO HAD ALMOST A MOTHER'S LOVE 
per0042 AND MOTHER'S RIGHTS IT WOULD BE PREVENTED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD NO FORTUNE 
per0043 HE HAD BEEN LUCKY IN HIS PROFESSION 
per0044 BUT SPENDING FREELY WHAT HAD COME FREELY HAD REALIZED NOTHING 
per0045 BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SOON BE RICH 
per0046 FULL OF LIFE AND ARDOUR HE KNEW THAT HE SHOULD SOON HAVE A SHIP 
per0047 AND SOON BE ON A STATION THAT WOULD LEAD TO EVERYTHING HE WANTED 
per0048 HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN LUCKY HE KNEW HE SHOULD BE SO STILL 
per0049 SUCH CONFIDENCE POWERFUL IN ITS OWN WARMTH AND BEWITCHING 
per0050 IN THE WIT WHICH OFTEN EXPRESSED IT 
per0051 MUST HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR ANNE BUT LADY RUSSELL SAW IT VERY DIFFERENTLY 
per0052 HIS SANGUINE TEMPER AND FEARLESSNESS OF MIND OPERATED VERY DIFFERENTLY ON HER 
per0053 SHE SAW IN IT BUT AN AGGRAVATION OF THE EVIL 
per0054 IT ONLY ADDED A DANGEROUS CHARACTER TO HIMSELF HE WAS BRILLIANT 
per0055 HE WAS HEADSTRONG LADY RUSSELL HAD LITTLE TASTE FOR WIT 
per0056 AND OF ANYTHING APPROACHING TO IMPRUDENCE A HORROR 
per0057 SHE DEPRECATED THE CONNEXION IN EVERY LIGHT 
per0058 SUCH OPPOSITION AS THESE FEELINGS PRODUCED WAS MORE THAN ANNE COULD COMBAT 
per0059 YOUNG AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS 
per0060 IT MIGHT YET HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO WITHSTAND HER FATHER'S ILL WILL 
per0061 THOUGH UNSOFTENED BY ONE KIND WORD OR LOOK ON THE PART OF HER SISTER 
per0062 BUT LADY RUSSELL WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND RELIED ON COULD NOT 
per0063 WITH SUCH STEADINESS OF OPINION AND SUCH TENDERNESS OF MANNER 
per0064 BE CONTINUALLY ADVISING HER IN VAIN 
per0065 SHE WAS PERSUADED TO BELIEVE THE ENGAGEMENT A WRONG THING 
per0066 INDISCREET IMPROPER HARDLY CAPABLE OF SUCCESS AND NOT DESERVING IT 
per0067 BUT IT WAS NOT A MERELY SELFISH CAUTION UNDER WHICH SHE ACTED IN PUTTING AN END TO IT 
per0068 HAD SHE NOT IMAGINED HERSELF CONSULTING HIS GOOD 
per0069 EVEN MORE THAN HER OWN SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM UP 
per0070 THE BELIEF OF BEING PRUDENT AND SELF DENYING 
per0071 PRINCIPALLY FOR HIS ADVANTAGE WAS HER CHIEF CONSOLATION 
per0072 UNDER THE MISERY OF A PARTING A FINAL PARTING 
per0073 AND EVERY CONSOLATION WAS REQUIRED 
per0074 FOR SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER ALL THE ADDITIONAL PAIN OF OPINIONS ON HIS SIDE 
per0075 TOTALLY UNCONVINCED AND UNBENDING AND OF HIS FEELING HIMSELF ILL USED 
per0076 BY SO FORCED A RELINQUISHMENT HE HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY IN CONSEQUENCE 
per0077 A FEW MONTHS HAD SEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE 
per0078 BUT NOT WITH A FEW MONTHS ENDED ANNE'S SHARE OF SUFFERING FROM IT 
per0079 HER ATTACHMENT AND REGRETS HAD FOR A LONG TIME 
per0080 CLOUDED EVERY ENJOYMENT OF YOUTH 
per0081 AND AN EARLY LOSS OF BLOOM AND SPIRITS HAD BEEN THEIR LASTING EFFECT 
per0082 MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS WERE GONE SINCE THIS LITTLE HISTORY OF SORROWFUL INTEREST HAD REACHED ITS CLOSE 
per0083 AND TIME HAD SOFTENED DOWN MUCH PERHAPS NEARLY ALL OF PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HIM 
per0084 BUT SHE HAD BEEN TOO DEPENDENT ON TIME ALONE 
per0085 NO AID HAD BEEN GIVEN IN CHANGE OF PLACE 
per0086 EXCEPT IN ONE VISIT TO BATH SOON AFTER THE RUPTURE 
per0087 OR IN ANY NOVELTY OR ENLARGEMENT OF SOCIETY 
per0088 NO ONE HAD EVER COME WITHIN THE KELLYNCH CIRCLE 
per0089 WHO COULD BEAR A COMPARISON WITH FREDERICK WENTWORTH 
per0090 AS HE STOOD IN HER MEMORY NO SECOND ATTACHMENT 
per0091 THE ONLY THOROUGHLY NATURAL HAPPY AND SUFFICIENT CURE AT HER TIME OF LIFE 
per0092 HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO THE NICE TONE OF HER MIND 
per0093 THE FASTIDIOUSNESS OF HER TASTE IN THE SMALL LIMITS OF THE SOCIETY AROUND THEM 
per0094 SHE HAD BEEN SOLICITED WHEN ABOUT TWO AND TWENTY TO CHANGE HER NAME BY THE YOUNG MAN 
per0095 WHO NOT LONG AFTERWARDS FOUND A MORE WILLING MIND IN HER YOUNGER SISTER 
per0096 AND LADY RUSSELL HAD LAMENTED HER REFUSAL 
per0097 FOR CHARLES MUSGROVE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A MAN WHOSE LANDED PROPERTY 
per0098 AND GENERAL IMPORTANCE WERE SECOND IN THAT COUNTRY ONLY TO SIR WALTER'S 
per0099 AND OF GOOD CHARACTER AND APPEARANCE 
per0100 AND HOWEVER LADY RUSSELL MIGHT HAVE ASKED YET FOR SOMETHING MORE 
per0101 WHILE ANNE WAS NINETEEN 
per0102 SHE WOULD HAVE REJOICED TO SEE HER AT TWENTY TWO SO RESPECTABLY REMOVED 
per0103 FROM THE PARTIALITIES AND INJUSTICE OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE 
per0104 AND SETTLED SO PERMANENTLY NEAR HERSELF BUT IN THIS CASE 
per0105 ANNE HAD LEFT NOTHING FOR ADVICE TO DO AND THOUGH LADY RUSSELL 
per0106 AS SATISFIED AS EVER WITH HER OWN DISCRETION 
per0107 NEVER WISHED THE PAST UNDONE 
per0108 SHE BEGAN NOW TO HAVE THE ANXIETY WHICH BORDERS ON HOPELESSNESS FOR ANNE'S BEING TEMPTED 
per0109 BY SOME MAN OF TALENTS AND INDEPENDENCE 
per0110 TO ENTER A STATE FOR WHICH SHE HELD HER TO BE PECULIARLY FITTED 
per0111 BY HER WARM AFFECTIONS AND DOMESTIC HABITS THEY KNEW NOT EACH OTHER'S OPINION 
per0112 EITHER ITS CONSTANCY OR ITS CHANGE ON THE ONE LEADING POINT OF ANNE'S CONDUCT 
per0113 FOR THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER ALLUDED TO BUT ANNE AT 
per0114 SEVEN AND TWENTY THOUGHT VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT SHE HAD BEEN MADE TO THINK AT NINETEEN 
per0115 SHE DID NOT BLAME LADY RUSSELL 
per0116 SHE DID NOT BLAME HERSELF FOR HAVING BEEN GUIDED BY HER 
per0117 BUT SHE FELT THAT WERE ANY YOUNG PERSON IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES 
per0118 TO APPLY TO HER FOR COUNSEL 
per0119 THEY WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ANY OF SUCH CERTAIN IMMEDIATE WRETCHEDNESS 
per0120 SUCH UNCERTAIN FUTURE GOOD SHE WAS PERSUADED THAT 
per0121 UNDER EVERY DISADVANTAGE OF DISAPPROBATION AT HOME 
per0122 AND EVERY ANXIETY ATTENDING HIS PROFESSION ALL THEIR PROBABLE FEARS DELAYS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS 
per0123 SHE SHOULD YET HAVE BEEN A HAPPIER WOMAN IN MAINTAINING THE ENGAGEMENT 
per0124 THAN SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SACRIFICE OF IT AND THIS 
per0125 SHE FULLY BELIEVED HAD THE USUAL SHARE 
per0126 HAD EVEN MORE THAN THE USUAL SHARE OF ALL SUCH SOLICITUDES AND SUSPENSE BEEN THEIRS 
per0127 WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF THEIR CASE WHICH 
per0128 AS IT HAPPENED WOULD HAVE BESTOWED EARLIER PROSPERITY THAN COULD BE REASONABLY CALCULATED ON 
per0129 ALL HIS SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS ALL HIS CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED 
per0130 HIS GENIUS AND ARDOUR HAD SEEMED TO FORESEE AND TO COMMAND HIS PROSPEROUS PATH 
per0131 HE HAD VERY SOON AFTER THEIR ENGAGEMENT CEASED GOT EMPLOY 
per0132 AND ALL THAT HE HAD TOLD HER WOULD FOLLOW HAD TAKEN PLACE 
per0133 HE HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AND EARLY GAINED THE OTHER STEP IN RANK 
per0134 AND MUST NOW BY SUCCESSIVE CAPTURES HAVE MADE A HANDSOME FORTUNE 
per0135 SHE HAD ONLY NAVY LISTS AND NEWSPAPERS FOR HER AUTHORITY 
per0136 BUT SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HIS BEING RICH 
per0137 AND IN FAVOUR OF HIS CONSTANCY 
per0138 SHE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE HIM MARRIED 
per0139 HOW ELOQUENT COULD ANNE ELLIOT HAVE BEEN HOW ELOQUENT AT LEAST 
per0140 WERE HER WISHES ON THE SIDE OF EARLY WARM ATTACHMENT 
per0141 AND A CHEERFUL CONFIDENCE IN FUTURITY 
per0142 AGAINST THAT OVER ANXIOUS CAUTION WHICH SEEMS TO INSULT EXERTION AND DISTRUST PROVIDENCE 
per0143 SHE HAD BEEN FORCED INTO PRUDENCE IN HER YOUTH 
per0144 SHE LEARNED ROMANCE AS SHE GREW OLDER 
per0145 THE NATURAL SEQUEL OF AN UNNATURAL BEGINNING 
per0146 WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RECOLLECTIONS AND FEELINGS 
per0147 SHE COULD NOT HEAR THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S SISTER WAS LIKELY TO LIVE AT KELLYNCH 
per0148 WITHOUT A REVIVAL OF FORMER PAIN 
per0149 AND MANY A STROLL AND MANY A SIGH WERE NECESSARY 
per0150 TO DISPEL THE AGITATION OF THE IDEA 
per0151 SHE OFTEN TOLD HERSELF IT WAS FOLLY 
per0152 BEFORE SHE COULD HARDEN HER NERVES SUFFICIENTLY TO FEEL THE CONTINUAL DISCUSSION OF THE CROFTS 
per0153 AND THEIR BUSINESS NO EVIL SHE WAS ASSISTED HOWEVER 
per0154 BY THAT PERFECT INDIFFERENCE AND APPARENT UNCONSCIOUSNESS 
per0155 AMONG THE ONLY THREE OF HER OWN FRIENDS IN THE SECRET OF THE PAST 
per0156 WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO DENY ANY RECOLLECTION OF IT 
per0157 SHE COULD DO JUSTICE TO THE SUPERIORITY OF LADY RUSSELL'S MOTIVES IN THIS 
per0158 OVER THOSE OF HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH 
per0159 SHE COULD HONOUR ALL THE BETTER FEELINGS OF HER CALMNESS 
per0160 BUT THE GENERAL AIR OF OBLIVION AMONG THEM WAS HIGHLY IMPORTANT 
per0161 FROM WHATEVER IT SPRUNG AND IN THE EVENT OF ADMIRAL CROFT'S REALLY TAKING KELLYNCH HALL 
per0162 SHE REJOICED ANEW OVER THE CONVICTION WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN MOST GRATEFUL TO HER 
per0163 OF THE PAST BEING KNOWN TO THOSE THREE ONLY AMONG HER CONNEXIONS 
per0164 BY WHOM NO SYLLABLE SHE BELIEVED WOULD EVER BE WHISPERED 
per0165 AND IN THE TRUST THAT AMONG HIS 
per0166 THE BROTHER ONLY WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN RESIDING HAD RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION OF THEIR SHORT LIVED ENGAGEMENT 
per0167 THAT BROTHER HAD BEEN LONG REMOVED FROM THE COUNTRY 
per0168 AND BEING A SENSIBLE MAN AND MOREOVER A SINGLE MAN AT THE TIME 
per0169 SHE HAD A FOND DEPENDENCE ON NO HUMAN CREATURE'S HAVING HEARD OF IT FROM HIM 
per0170 THE SISTER MRS CROFT 
per0171 HAD THEN BEEN OUT OF ENGLAND ACCOMPANYING HER HUSBAND ON A FOREIGN STATION 
per0172 AND HER OWN SISTER MARY HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL WHILE IT ALL OCCURRED 
per0173 AND NEVER ADMITTED BY THE PRIDE OF SOME 
per0174 AND THE DELICACY OF OTHERS TO THE SMALLEST KNOWLEDGE OF IT AFTERWARDS 
per0175 WITH THESE SUPPORTS SHE HOPED THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN HERSELF AND THE CROFTS 
per0176 WHICH WITH LADY RUSSELL STILL RESIDENT IN KELLYNCH AND MARY FIXED ONLY THREE MILES OFF 
per0177 MUST BE ANTICIPATED NEED NOT INVOLVE ANY PARTICULAR AWKWARDNESS
