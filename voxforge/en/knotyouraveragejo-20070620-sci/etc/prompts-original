sci0003 OR TO VOLUNTEER PLEASE VISIT LIBRIVOX DOT ORG THE 
sci0004 ADVANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY BY T H 
sci0005 HUXLEY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE THE MOST OBVIOUS 
sci0006 AND THE MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE HISTORY OF CIVILISATION 
sci0007 DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IS THE WONDERFUL INCREASE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION 
sci0008 BY THE APPLICATION OF MACHINERY THE IMPROVEMENT OF OLD TECHNICAL PROCESSES 
sci0009 AND THE INVENTION OF NEW ONES ACCOMPANIED BY AN EVEN MORE REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT 
sci0010 OF OLD AND NEW MEANS OF LOCOMOTION AND INTERCOMMUNICATION 
sci0011 BY THIS RAPID AND VAST MULTIPLICATION OF THE COMMODITIES 
sci0012 AND CONVENIENCES OF EXISTENCE THE GENERAL STANDARD OF COMFORT HAS BEEN RAISED 
sci0013 THE RAVAGES OF PESTILENCE AND FAMINE HAVE BEEN CHECKED 
sci0014 AND THE NATURAL OBSTACLES WHICH TIME AND SPACE OFFER TO MUTUAL INTERCOURSE 
sci0015 HAVE BEEN REDUCED IN A MANNER AND TO AN EXTENT 
sci0016 UNKNOWN TO FORMER AGES THE DIMINUTION OR REMOVAL OF LOCAL IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE 
sci0017 THE CREATION OF COMMON INTERESTS AMONG THE MOST WIDELY SEPARATED PEOPLES AND 
sci0018 THE STRENGTHENING OF THE FORCES OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH AGAINST THOSE OF 
sci0019 POLITICAL OR SOCIAL ANARCHY THUS EFFECTED 
sci0020 HAVE EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ON THE PRESENT AND FUTURE FORTUNES OF MANKIND 
sci0021 THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH MAY BE DIVINED BUT CANNOT AS YET 
sci0022 BE ESTIMATED AT ITS FULL VALUE THIS REVOLUTION FOR IT IS NOTHING LESS 
sci0023 IN THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF MODERN CIVILISATION HAS 
sci0024 BEEN PRECEDED ACCOMPANIED AND IN GREAT MEASURE CAUSED 
sci0025 BY A LESS OBVIOUS BUT NO LESS MARVELLOUS INCREASE OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE AND 
sci0026 ESPECIALLY OF THAT PART OF IT WHICH IS KNOWN AS PHYSICAL SCIENCE 
sci0027 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD 
sci0028 TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF THE MATERIAL WORLD 
sci0029 NOT THAT THE GROWTH OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS AN EXCLUSIVE PREROGATIVE OF THE VICTORIAN AGE 
sci0030 ITS PRESENT STRENGTH AND VOLUME MERELY INDICATE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF A STREAM 
sci0031 WHICH TOOK ITS RISE ALONGSIDE OF THE PRIMAL FOUNTS OF PHILOSOPHY LITERATURE AND ART 
sci0032 IN ANCIENT GREECE AND AFTER BEING DAMMED UP FOR A THOUSAND YEARS 
sci0033 ONCE MORE BEGAN TO FLOW THREE CENTURIES AGO 
sci0034 IT MAY BE DOUBTED IF EVEN HANDED JUSTICE 
sci0035 AS FREE FROM FULSOME PANEGYRIC AS FROM CAPTIOUS DEPRECIATION 
sci0036 HAS EVER YET BEEN DEALT OUT TO THE SAGES OF ANTIQUITY 
sci0037 WHO FOR EIGHT CENTURIES FROM THE TIME OF THALES TO THAT OF GALEN 
sci0038 TOILED AT THE FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE BUT 
sci0039 WITHOUT ENTERING INTO THE DISCUSSION OF THAT LARGE QUESTION IT 
sci0040 IS CERTAIN THAT THE LABORS OF THESE EARLY WORKERS IN THE FIELD OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE 
sci0041 WERE BROUGHT TO A STANDSTILL BY THE DECAY AND DISRUPTION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 
sci0042 THE CONSEQUENT DISORGANISATION OF SOCIETY AND THE DIVERSION OF MEN'S THOUGHTS FROM SUBLUNARY MATTERS 
sci0043 TO THE PROBLEMS OF THE SUPERNATURAL WORLD 
sci0044 SUGGESTED BY CHRISTIAN DOGMA IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
sci0045 AND NOTWITHSTANDING SPORADIC ATTEMPTS TO RECALL MEN TO THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE 
sci0046 HERE AND THERE IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES 
sci0047 THAT PHYSICAL SCIENCE MADE A NEW START FOUNDING ITSELF AT FIRST 
sci0048 ALTOGETHER UPON THAT WHICH HAD BEEN DONE BY THE GREEKS 
sci0049 INDEED IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE MEN OF THE 
sci0050 RENAISSANCE THOUGH STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE OLD PHILOSOPHERS 
sci0051 WERE A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY SAW AS MUCH AS THEIR FORERUNNERS 
sci0052 HAD DONE THE FIRST SERIOUS ATTEMPTS TO CARRY FURTHER THE UNFINISHED WORK OF ARCHIMEDES 
sci0053 HIPPARCHUS AND PTOLEMY OF ARISTOTLE AND OF GALEN 
sci0054 NATURALLY ENOUGH AROSE AMONG THE ASTRONOMERS AND THE PHYSICIANS 
sci0055a FOR THE IMPERIOUS NECESSITY OF SEEKING SOME REMEDY FOR THE PHYSICAL ILLS OF LIFE 
sci0055b HAD INSURED THE PRESERVATION OF MORE OR LESS OF THE WISDOM OF HIPPOCRATES AND HIS SUCCESSORS 
sci0056 AND BY A HAPPY CONJUNCTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES 
sci0057 THE JEWISH AND THE ARABIAN PHYSICIANS AND PHILOSOPHERS 
sci0058 ESCAPED MANY OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH AT THAT TIME 
sci0059 BLIGHTED NATURAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE CHRISTIAN WORLD ON THE OTHER HAND 
sci0060 THE SUPERSTITIOUS HOPES AND FEARS WHICH AFFORDED COUNTENANCE TO ASTROLOGY AND TO ALCHEMY 
sci0061 ALSO SHELTERED ASTRONOMY AND THE GERMS OF CHEMISTRY 
sci0062 WHETHER FOR THIS OR FOR SOME BETTER REASON THE FOUNDERS OF THE SCHOOLS OF THE MIDDLE AGES INCLUDED ASTRONOMY 
sci0063 ALONG WITH GEOMETRY ARITHMETIC AND MUSIC 
sci0064 AS ONE OF THE FOUR BRANCHES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION 
sci0065 AND IN THIS RESPECT 
sci0066 IT IS ONLY JUST TO THEM TO OBSERVE THAT THEY WERE FAR IN ADVANCE OF THOSE WHO SIT IN THEIR SEATS 
sci0067 THE SCHOOL MEN CONSIDERED NO ONE TO BE PROPERLY EDUCATED 
sci0068 UNLESS HE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH AT ANY RATE ONE BRANCH OF 
sci0069 PHYSICAL SCIENCE WE HAVE NOT EVEN YET REACHED THAT STAGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT 
sci0070 IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
sci0071 THE MEN OF THE RENAISSANCE COULD SHOW THAT THEY HAD ALREADY PUT OUT TO GOOD INTEREST 
sci0072 THE TREASURE BEQUEATHED TO THEM BY THE GREEKS 
sci0073 THEY HAD PRODUCED THE ASTRONOMICAL SYSTEM OF COPERNICUS 
sci0074 WITH KEPLER'S GREAT ADDITIONS THE ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES AND THE PHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF GALILEO 
sci0075 THE MECHANICS OF STEVINUS AND THE DE MAGNETE OF GILBERT 
sci0076 THE ANATOMY OF THE GREAT FRENCH AND ITALIAN SCHOOLS 
sci0077 AND THE PHYSIOLOGY OF HARVEY IN ITALY WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED GREECE 
sci0078 IN THE HEGEMONY OF THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD 
sci0079 THE ACCADEMIA DEI LYNCEI AND SUNDRY OTHER SUCH ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE 
sci0080 THE MODELS OF ALL SUBSEQUENT ACADEMIES AND SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES 
sci0081 HAD BEEN FOUNDED WHILE THE LITERARY SKILL AND BITING WIT OF GALILEO 
sci0082 HAD MADE THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS OF THE DAY 
sci0083 NOT ONLY INTELLIGIBLE BUT ATTRACTIVE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
sci0084 IN OUR OWN COUNTRY FRANCIS BACON 
sci0085 HAD ESSAYED TO SUM UP THE PAST OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 
sci0086 AND TO INDICATE THE PATH WHICH IT MUST FOLLOW 
sci0087 IF ITS GREAT DESTINIES WERE TO BE FULFILLED AND 
sci0088 THOUGH THE ATTEMPT WAS JUST SUCH A MAGNIFICENT FAILURE AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM A MAN OF GREAT ENDOWMENTS 
sci0089 WHO WAS SO SINGULARLY DEVOID OF SCIENTIFIC INSIGHT 
sci0090 THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THE WORK ALREADY ACHIEVED 
sci0091 BY THE TRUE INSTAURATORS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 
sci0092 YET THE MAJESTIC ELOQUENCE AND THE FERVID VATICINATIONS OF ONE WHO WAS CONSPICUOUS ALIKE 
sci0093 BY THE GREATNESS OF HIS RISE 
sci0094 AND THE DEPTH OF HIS FALL DREW THE ATTENTION OF ALL THE WORLD 
sci0095 TO THE NEW BIRTH OF TIME 
sci0096 BUT IT IS NOT EASY TO DISCOVER SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE 
sci0097 THAT THE NOVUM ORGANUM HAD 
sci0098 ANY DIRECT BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE 
sci0099 NO DELUSION IS GREATER THAN THE NOTION THAT METHOD AND INDUSTRY 
sci0100 CAN MAKE UP FOR LACK OF MOTHERWIT EITHER IN SCIENCE 
sci0101 OR IN PRACTICAL LIFE AND IT IS STRANGE THAT 
sci0102 WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MANKIND BACON SHOULD HAVE DREAMED THAT HIS OR ANY OTHER 
sci0103 VIA INVENIENDI SCIENTIAS WOULD LEVEL MEN'S WITS AND LEAVE LITTLE SCOPE FOR THAT 
sci0104 INBORN CAPACITY WHICH IS CALLED GENIUS AS A MATTER OF FACT BACON'S VIA 
sci0105 HAS PROVED HOPELESSLY IMPRACTICABLE WHILE THE ANTICIPATION OF NATURE 
sci0106 BY THE INVENTION OF HYPOTHESES BASED ON INCOMPLETE INDUCTIONS 
sci0107 WHICH HE SPECIALLY CONDEMNS HAS PROVED ITSELF TO BE A MOST EFFICIENT 
sci0108 INDEED AN INDISPENSABLE INSTRUMENT OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS FINALLY THAT TRANSCENDENTAL ALCHEMY 
sci0109 THE SUPERINDUCEMENT OF NEW FORMS ON MATTER 
sci0110 WHICH BACON DECLARES TO BE THE SUPREME AIM OF SCIENCE 
sci0111 HAS BEEN WHOLLY IGNORED BY THOSE WHO HAVE CREATED THE PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE 
sci0112 OF THE PRESENT DAY EVEN THE ELOQUENT ADVOCACY OF THE CHANCELLOR 
sci0113 BROUGHT NO UNMIXED GOOD TO PHYSICAL SCIENCE 
sci0114 IT WAS NATURAL ENOUGH THAT THE MAN WHO IN HIS BETTER MOMENTS TOOK 
sci0115 ALL KNOWLEDGE FOR HIS PATRIMONY BUT IN HIS WORSE 
sci0116 SOLD THAT BIRTHRIGHT FOR THE MESS OF POTTAGE OF 
sci0117 COURT FAVOR AND PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS FOR POMP AND SHOW 
sci0118 SHOULD BE LED TO ATTACH AN UNDUE VALUE TO 
sci0119 THE PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES WHICH HE FORESAW AS ROGER BACON AND INDEED SENECA 
sci0120 HAD FORESEEN LONG BEFORE HIS TIME MUST FOLLOW IN THE TRAIN OF THE ADVANCEMENT OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE 
sci0121a THE BURDEN OF BACON'S PLEADINGS FOR SCIENCE IS THE GATHERING OF FRUIT 
sci0121b THE IMPORTANCE OF WINNING SOLID MATERIAL ADVANTAGES BY THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE 
sci0122 AND THE DESIRABLENESS OF LIMITING THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC METHODS 
sci0123 OF INQUIRY TO THAT FIELD BACON'S YOUNGER CONTEMPORARY HOBBES 
sci0124 CASTING ASIDE THE PRUDENT RESERVE OF HIS PREDECESSOR 
sci0125 IN REGARD TO THOSE MATTERS 
sci0126 ABOUT WHICH THE CROWN OR THE CHURCH MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY EXTENDED SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF INQUIRY 
sci0127 TO THE PHENOMENA OF MIND AND THE PROBLEMS OF SOCIAL ORGANISATION 
sci0128 WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE INDICATED THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE PROVINCE OF REAL 
sci0129 AND THAT OF IMAGINARY KNOWLEDGE THE PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE LEVIATHAN 
sci0130 EMBODY A COHERENT SYSTEM OF PURELY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT 
sci0131 IN LANGUAGE WHICH IS A MODEL OF CLEAR AND VIGOROUS ENGLISH STYLE AT 
sci0132 THE SAME TIME IN FRANCE A MAN OF FAR GREATER SCIENTIFIC CAPACITY 
sci0133 THAN EITHER BACON OR HOBBES RENE DESCARTES NOT ONLY IN HIS IMMORTAL 
sci0134 DISCOURS DE LA METHODE AND ELSEWHERE WENT DOWN TO THE FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY 
sci0135 BUT IN HIS PRINCIPES DE PHILOSOPHIE INDICATED 
sci0136 WHERE THE GOAL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE REALLY LAY HOWEVER 
sci0137 DESCARTES WAS AN EMINENT MATHEMATICIAN AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE BENT OF 
sci0138 HIS MIND LED HIM TO OVERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF DEDUCTIVE REASONING FROM GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
sci0139 AS MUCH AS BACON HAD UNDERESTIMATED IT THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 
sci0140 HAS BEEN EFFECTED NEITHER BY BACONIANS NOR BY CARTESIANS AS SUCH 
sci0141 BUT BY MEN LIKE GALILEO AND HARVEY BOYLE AND NEWTON WHO 
sci0142 WOULD HAVE DONE THEIR WORK JUST AS WELL IF NEITHER BACON NOR DESCARTES 
sci0143 HAD EVER PROPOUNDED THEIR VIEWS RESPECTING THE MANNER IN WHICH SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION 
sci0144 SHOULD BE PURSUED 
sci0145a THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE DURING THE FIRST CENTURY AFTER BACON'S DEATH 
sci0145b BY MEANS VERIFIED HIS SANGUINE PREDICTION OF THE FRUITS WHICH IT WOULD YIELD 
sci0146 FOR THOUGH THE REVIVED AND RENEWED STUDY OF NATURE HAD SPREAD AND GROWN TO AN EXTENT WHICH SURPASSED 
sci0147 REASONABLE EXPECTATION THE PRACTICAL RESULTS THE GOOD TO MEN'S ESTATE 
sci0148 WERE AT FIRST BY NO MEANS APPARENT 
sci0149a SIXTY YEARS AFTER BACON'S DEATH NEWTON HAD CROWNED THE LONG LABORS OF THE ASTRONOMERS AND THE PHYSICISTS
sci0149b BY COORDINATING THE PHENOMENA OF SOLAR MOTION THROUGHOUT THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE 
sci0150 INTO ONE VAST SYSTEM BUT THE PRINCIPIA HELPED NO MAN TO EITHER WEALTH 
sci0151 OR COMFORT DESCARTES NEWTON AND LEIBNITZ 
sci0152 HAD OPENED UP NEW WORLDS TO THE MATHEMATICIAN BUT THE ACQUISITIONS OF THEIR GENIUS ENRICHED 
sci0153 ONLY MAN'S IDEAL ESTATE DESCARTES HAD LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF RATIONAL COSMOGONY 
sci0154 AND OF PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY BOYLE HAD PRODUCED MODELS OF EXPERIMENTATION 
sci0155 IN VARIOUS BRANCHES OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY PASCAL 
sci0156 AND TORRICELLI HAD WEIGHED THE AIR MALPIGHI AND GREW 
sci0157 RAY AND WILLOUGHBY HAD DONE WORK OF NO LESS IMPORTANCE IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 
sci0158 BUT WEAVING AND SPINNING WERE CARRIED ON WITH THE OLD APPLIANCES 
sci0159 NOBODY COULD TRAVEL FASTER BY SEA OR BY LAND THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS TIME IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY 
sci0160 AND KING GEORGE COULD SEND A MESSAGE FROM LONDON TO YORK 
sci0161 NO FASTER THAN KING JOHN MIGHT HAVE DONE 
sci0162 METALS WERE WORKED FROM THEIR ORES BY IMMEMORIAL RULE OF THUMB 
sci0163 AND THE CENTRE OF THE IRON TRADE OF THESE ISLANDS WAS STILL AMONG THE OAK FORESTS OF SUSSEX 
sci0164 THE UTMOST SKILL OF OUR MECHANICIANS DID NOT GET BEYOND THE PRODUCTION OF 
sci0165 A COARSE WATCH THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS ILLUSTRATED BY A 
sci0166 HOST OF GREAT NAMES IN SCIENCE ENGLISH FRENCH GERMAN AND ITALIAN 
sci0167 ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELDS OF CHEMISTRY GEOLOGY AND BIOLOGY 
sci0168 BUT THIS DEEPENING AND BROADENING OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE PRODUCED NEXT TO NO IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL BENEFITS 
sci0169 EVEN IF AT THIS TIME FRANCIS BACON COULD HAVE RETURNED TO THE SCENE 
sci0170 OF HIS GREATNESS AND OF HIS LITTLENESS 
sci0171 HE MUST HAVE REGARDED THE PHILOSOPHIC WORLD WHICH PRAISED AND DISREGARDED HIS PRECEPTS 
sci0172 WITH GREAT DISFAVOR IF GHOSTS ARE CONSISTENT HE WOULD HAVE SAID 
sci0173 THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL WASTING THEIR TIME JUST AS GILBERT 
sci0174 AND KEPLER AND GALILEO AND MY WORTHY PHYSICIAN HARVEY DID IN MY DAY 
sci0175 WHERE ARE THE FRUITS OF THE RESTORATION OF SCIENCE WHICH I PROMISED 
sci0176 THIS ACCUMULATION OF BARE KNOWLEDGE IS ALL VERY WELL BUT 
sci0177 CUI BONO NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE IS DOING WHAT I TOLD HIM SPECIALLY TO DO 
sci0178 AND SEEKING THAT SECRET OF THE CAUSE OF FORMS 
sci0179 WHICH WILL ENABLE MEN TO DEAL AT WILL WITH MATTER 
sci0180 AND SUPERINDUCE NEW NATURES UPON THE OLD FOUNDATIONS 
sci0181 BUT A LITTLE LATER THAT GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE BEYOND IMAGINABLE UTILITARIAN ENDS 
sci0182 WHICH IS THE CONDITION PRECEDENT OF ITS PRACTICAL UTILITY 
sci0183 BEGAN TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT 
sci0184 UPON PRACTICAL LIFE AND THE OPERATION OF THAT PART OF NATURE 
sci0185 WE CALL HUMAN UPON THE REST BEGAN TO CREATE 
sci0186 NOT NEW NATURES IN BACON'S SENSE BUT A NEW NATURE 
sci0187 THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH IS DEPENDENT UPON MEN'S EFFORTS 
sci0188 WHICH IS SUBSERVIENT TO THEIR WANTS AND WHICH WOULD DISAPPEAR 
sci0189 IF MAN'S SHAPING AND GUIDING HAND WERE WITHDRAWN EVERY MECHANICAL ARTIFICE 
sci0190 EVERY CHEMICALLY PURE SUBSTANCE EMPLOYED IN MANUFACTURE EVERY ABNORMALLY FERTILE RACE OF PLANTS 
sci0191 OR RAPIDLY GROWING AND FATTENING BREED OF ANIMALS 
sci0192 IS A PART OF THE NEW NATURE CREATED BY SCIENCE 
sci0193 WITHOUT IT THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS OF MODERN EUROPE AND AMERICA 
sci0194 MUST RETAIN THEIR PRIMITIVE SPARSELY INHABITED AGRICULTURAL OR PASTORAL CONDITION 
sci0195 IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR WEALTH AND THE CONDITION OF OUR SAFETY FROM SUBMERGENCE 
sci0196 BY ANOTHER FLOOD OF BARBAROUS HORDES 
sci0197 IT IS THE BOND WHICH UNITES INTO A SOLID POLITICAL WHOLE 
sci0198 REGIONS LARGER THAN ANY EMPIRE OF ANTIQUITY IT SECURES US FROM THE RECURRENCE 
sci0199 OF THE PESTILENCES AND FAMINES OF FORMER TIMES 
sci0200 IT IS THE SOURCE OF ENDLESS COMFORTS AND CONVENIENCES 
sci0201 WHICH ARE NOT MERE LUXURIES BUT CONDUCE TO PHYSICAL AND MORAL WELL BEING 
sci0202 DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THIS NEW BIRTH OF TIME THIS NEW NATURE 
sci0203 BEGOTTEN BY SCIENCE UPON FACT HAS PRESSED ITSELF DAILY AND HOURLY 
sci0204 UPON OUR ATTENTION AND HAS WORKED MIRACLES WHICH HAVE MODIFIED THE WHOLE FASHION 
sci0205 OF OUR LIVES WHAT WONDER THEN IF THESE ASTONISHING FRUITS OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE 
sci0206 ARE TOO OFTEN REGARDED BY BOTH FRIENDS AND ENEMIES 
sci0207 AS THE BE ALL AND END ALL OF SCIENCE 
sci0208 WHAT WONDER IF SOME EULOGISE AND OTHERS REVILE 
sci0209 THE NEW PHILOSOPHY FOR ITS UTILITARIAN ENDS AND ITS MERELY MATERIAL TRIUMPHS 
sci0210 IN TRUTH THE NEW PHILOSOPHY DESERVES NEITHER THE PRAISE OF ITS EULOGISTS NOR THE BLAME OF ITS SLANDERERS 
sci0211 AS I HAVE POINTED OUT ITS 
sci0212 DISCIPLES WERE GUIDED BY NO SEARCH AFTER PRACTICAL FRUITS DURING THE GREAT PERIOD OF ITS GROWTH AND IT REACHED ADOLESCENCE 
sci0213 WITHOUT BEING STIMULATED BY ANY REWARDS OF THAT NATURE 
sci0214 THE BARE ENUMERATION OF THE NAMES OF THE MEN WHO 
sci0215 WERE THE GREAT LIGHTS OF SCIENCE IN THE LATTER PART OF THE 
sci0216 EIGHTEENTH AND THE FIRST DECADE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY OF HERSCHEL 
sci0217 OF LAPLACE OF YOUNG OF FRESNEL OF OERSTED OF CAVENDISH 
sci0218 OF LAVOISIER OF DAVY OF LAMARCK OF CUVIER OF JUSSIEU 
sci0219 OF DECANDOLLE OF WERNER AND OF HUTTON 
sci0220 SUFFICES TO INDICATE THE STRENGTH OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN THE AGE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THAT OF WHICH I HAVE TO TREAT 
sci0221 BUT OF WHICH OF THESE GREAT MEN CAN IT BE SAID 
sci0222 THAT THEIR LABORS WERE DIRECTED TO PRACTICAL ENDS 
sci0223 I DO NOT CALL TO MIND EVEN AN INVENTION OF PRACTICAL UTILITY 
sci0224 WHICH WE OWE TO ANY OF THEM EXCEPT THE SAFETY LAMP OF DAVY 
sci0225 WERNER CERTAINLY PAID ATTENTION TO MINING AND I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN JAMES WATT 
sci0226 BUT THOUGH SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE IMPROVEMENTS 
sci0227 BY WHICH WATT CONVERTED THE STEAM ENGINE INVENTED LONG BEFORE HIS TIME 
sci0228 INTO THE OBEDIENT SLAVE OF MAN 
sci0229 WERE SUGGESTED AND GUIDED BY HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES 
sci0230 HIS SKILL AS A PRACTICAL MECHANICIAN AND THE EFFICIENCY OF 
sci0231 BOLTON'S WORKMEN HAD QUITE AS MUCH TO DO WITH THE REALISATION OF HIS PROJECTS
