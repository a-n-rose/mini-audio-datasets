knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0005 HUXLEY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE THE MOST OBVIOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0006 AND THE MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE HISTORY OF CIVILISATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0007 DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IS THE WONDERFUL INCREASE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0008 BY THE APPLICATION OF MACHINERY THE IMPROVEMENT OF OLD TECHNICAL PROCESSES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0009 AND THE INVENTION OF NEW ONES ACCOMPANIED BY AN EVEN MORE REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0010 OF OLD AND NEW MEANS OF LOCOMOTION AND INTERCOMMUNICATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0011 BY THIS RAPID AND VAST MULTIPLICATION OF THE COMMODITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0012 AND CONVENIENCES OF EXISTENCE THE GENERAL STANDARD OF COMFORT HAS BEEN RAISED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0013 THE RAVAGES OF PESTILENCE AND FAMINE HAVE BEEN CHECKED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0014 AND THE NATURAL OBSTACLES WHICH TIME AND SPACE OFFER TO MUTUAL INTERCOURSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0015 HAVE BEEN REDUCED IN A MANNER AND TO AN EXTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0016 UNKNOWN TO FORMER AGES THE DIMINUTION OR REMOVAL OF LOCAL IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0017 THE CREATION OF COMMON INTERESTS AMONG THE MOST WIDELY SEPARATED PEOPLES AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0018 THE STRENGTHENING OF THE FORCES OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH AGAINST THOSE OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0019 POLITICAL OR SOCIAL ANARCHY THUS EFFECTED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0020 HAVE EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ON THE PRESENT AND FUTURE FORTUNES OF MANKIND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0021 THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH MAY BE DIVINED BUT CANNOT AS YET
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0022 BE ESTIMATED AT ITS FULL VALUE THIS REVOLUTION FOR IT IS NOTHING LESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0023 IN THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF MODERN CIVILISATION HAS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0024 BEEN PRECEDED ACCOMPANIED AND IN GREAT MEASURE CAUSED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0025 BY A LESS OBVIOUS BUT NO LESS MARVELLOUS INCREASE OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0026 ESPECIALLY OF THAT PART OF IT WHICH IS KNOWN AS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0027 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0028 TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF THE MATERIAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0029 NOT THAT THE GROWTH OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS AN EXCLUSIVE PREROGATIVE OF THE VICTORIAN AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0030 ITS PRESENT STRENGTH AND VOLUME MERELY INDICATE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF A STREAM
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0031 WHICH TOOK ITS RISE ALONGSIDE OF THE PRIMAL FOUNTS OF PHILOSOPHY LITERATURE AND ART
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0032 IN ANCIENT GREECE AND AFTER BEING DAMMED UP FOR A THOUSAND YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0033 ONCE MORE BEGAN TO FLOW THREE CENTURIES AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0034 IT MAY BE DOUBTED IF EVEN HANDED JUSTICE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0035 AS FREE FROM FULSOME PANEGYRIC AS FROM CAPTIOUS DEPRECIATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0036 HAS EVER YET BEEN DEALT OUT TO THE SAGES OF ANTIQUITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0037 WHO FOR EIGHT CENTURIES FROM THE TIME OF THALES TO THAT OF GALEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0038 TOILED AT THE FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0039 WITHOUT ENTERING INTO THE DISCUSSION OF THAT LARGE QUESTION IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0040 IS CERTAIN THAT THE LABORS OF THESE EARLY WORKERS IN THE FIELD OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0041 WERE BROUGHT TO A STANDSTILL BY THE DECAY AND DISRUPTION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0042 THE CONSEQUENT DISORGANISATION OF SOCIETY AND THE DIVERSION OF MEN'S THOUGHTS FROM SUBLUNARY MATTERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0043 TO THE PROBLEMS OF THE SUPERNATURAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0044 SUGGESTED BY CHRISTIAN DOGMA IN THE MIDDLE AGES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0045 AND NOTWITHSTANDING SPORADIC ATTEMPTS TO RECALL MEN TO THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0046 HERE AND THERE IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0047 THAT PHYSICAL SCIENCE MADE A NEW START FOUNDING ITSELF AT FIRST
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0048 ALTOGETHER UPON THAT WHICH HAD BEEN DONE BY THE GREEKS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0049 INDEED IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE MEN OF THE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0050 RENAISSANCE THOUGH STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE OLD PHILOSOPHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0051 WERE A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY SAW AS MUCH AS THEIR FORERUNNERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0052 HAD DONE THE FIRST SERIOUS ATTEMPTS TO CARRY FURTHER THE UNFINISHED WORK OF ARCHIMEDES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0053 HIPPARCHUS AND PTOLEMY OF ARISTOTLE AND OF GALEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0054 NATURALLY ENOUGH AROSE AMONG THE ASTRONOMERS AND THE PHYSICIANS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0055a FOR THE IMPERIOUS NECESSITY OF SEEKING SOME REMEDY FOR THE PHYSICAL ILLS OF LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0055b HAD INSURED THE PRESERVATION OF MORE OR LESS OF THE WISDOM OF HIPPOCRATES AND HIS SUCCESSORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0056 AND BY A HAPPY CONJUNCTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0057 THE JEWISH AND THE ARABIAN PHYSICIANS AND PHILOSOPHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0058 ESCAPED MANY OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH AT THAT TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0059 BLIGHTED NATURAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE CHRISTIAN WORLD ON THE OTHER HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0060 THE SUPERSTITIOUS HOPES AND FEARS WHICH AFFORDED COUNTENANCE TO ASTROLOGY AND TO ALCHEMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0061 ALSO SHELTERED ASTRONOMY AND THE GERMS OF CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0062 WHETHER FOR THIS OR FOR SOME BETTER REASON THE FOUNDERS OF THE SCHOOLS OF THE MIDDLE AGES INCLUDED ASTRONOMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0063 ALONG WITH GEOMETRY ARITHMETIC AND MUSIC
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0064 AS ONE OF THE FOUR BRANCHES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0065 AND IN THIS RESPECT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0066 IT IS ONLY JUST TO THEM TO OBSERVE THAT THEY WERE FAR IN ADVANCE OF THOSE WHO SIT IN THEIR SEATS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0067 THE SCHOOL MEN CONSIDERED NO ONE TO BE PROPERLY EDUCATED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0068 UNLESS HE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH AT ANY RATE ONE BRANCH OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0069 PHYSICAL SCIENCE WE HAVE NOT EVEN YET REACHED THAT STAGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0070 IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0071 THE MEN OF THE RENAISSANCE COULD SHOW THAT THEY HAD ALREADY PUT OUT TO GOOD INTEREST
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0072 THE TREASURE BEQUEATHED TO THEM BY THE GREEKS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0073 THEY HAD PRODUCED THE ASTRONOMICAL SYSTEM OF COPERNICUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0074 WITH KEPLER'S GREAT ADDITIONS THE ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES AND THE PHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF GALILEO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0075 THE MECHANICS OF STEVINUS AND THE DE MAGNETE OF GILBERT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0076 THE ANATOMY OF THE GREAT FRENCH AND ITALIAN SCHOOLS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0077 AND THE PHYSIOLOGY OF HARVEY IN ITALY WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED GREECE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0078 IN THE HEGEMONY OF THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0079 THE ACCADEMIA DEI LYNCEI AND SUNDRY OTHER SUCH ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0080 THE MODELS OF ALL SUBSEQUENT ACADEMIES AND SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0081 HAD BEEN FOUNDED WHILE THE LITERARY SKILL AND BITING WIT OF GALILEO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0082 HAD MADE THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS OF THE DAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0083 NOT ONLY INTELLIGIBLE BUT ATTRACTIVE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0084 IN OUR OWN COUNTRY FRANCIS BACON
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0085 HAD ESSAYED TO SUM UP THE PAST OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0086 AND TO INDICATE THE PATH WHICH IT MUST FOLLOW
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0087 IF ITS GREAT DESTINIES WERE TO BE FULFILLED AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0088 THOUGH THE ATTEMPT WAS JUST SUCH A MAGNIFICENT FAILURE AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM A MAN OF GREAT ENDOWMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0089 WHO WAS SO SINGULARLY DEVOID OF SCIENTIFIC INSIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0090 THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THE WORK ALREADY ACHIEVED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0091 BY THE TRUE INSTAURATORS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0092 YET THE MAJESTIC ELOQUENCE AND THE FERVID VATICINATIONS OF ONE WHO WAS CONSPICUOUS ALIKE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0093 BY THE GREATNESS OF HIS RISE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0094 AND THE DEPTH OF HIS FALL DREW THE ATTENTION OF ALL THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0095 TO THE NEW BIRTH OF TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0096 BUT IT IS NOT EASY TO DISCOVER SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0097 THAT THE NOVUM ORGANUM HAD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0098 ANY DIRECT BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0099 NO DELUSION IS GREATER THAN THE NOTION THAT METHOD AND INDUSTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0100 CAN MAKE UP FOR LACK OF MOTHERWIT EITHER IN SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0101 OR IN PRACTICAL LIFE AND IT IS STRANGE THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0102 WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MANKIND BACON SHOULD HAVE DREAMED THAT HIS OR ANY OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0103 VIA INVENIENDI SCIENTIAS WOULD LEVEL MEN'S WITS AND LEAVE LITTLE SCOPE FOR THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0104 INBORN CAPACITY WHICH IS CALLED GENIUS AS A MATTER OF FACT BACON'S VIA
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0105 HAS PROVED HOPELESSLY IMPRACTICABLE WHILE THE ANTICIPATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0106 BY THE INVENTION OF HYPOTHESES BASED ON INCOMPLETE INDUCTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0107 WHICH HE SPECIALLY CONDEMNS HAS PROVED ITSELF TO BE A MOST EFFICIENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0108 INDEED AN INDISPENSABLE INSTRUMENT OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS FINALLY THAT TRANSCENDENTAL ALCHEMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0109 THE SUPERINDUCEMENT OF NEW FORMS ON MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0110 WHICH BACON DECLARES TO BE THE SUPREME AIM OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0111 HAS BEEN WHOLLY IGNORED BY THOSE WHO HAVE CREATED THE PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0112 OF THE PRESENT DAY EVEN THE ELOQUENT ADVOCACY OF THE CHANCELLOR
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0113 BROUGHT NO UNMIXED GOOD TO PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0114 IT WAS NATURAL ENOUGH THAT THE MAN WHO IN HIS BETTER MOMENTS TOOK
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0115 ALL KNOWLEDGE FOR HIS PATRIMONY BUT IN HIS WORSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0116 SOLD THAT BIRTHRIGHT FOR THE MESS OF POTTAGE OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0117 COURT FAVOR AND PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS FOR POMP AND SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0118 SHOULD BE LED TO ATTACH AN UNDUE VALUE TO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0119 THE PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES WHICH HE FORESAW AS ROGER BACON AND INDEED SENECA
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0120 HAD FORESEEN LONG BEFORE HIS TIME MUST FOLLOW IN THE TRAIN OF THE ADVANCEMENT OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0121a THE BURDEN OF BACON'S PLEADINGS FOR SCIENCE IS THE GATHERING OF FRUIT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0121b THE IMPORTANCE OF WINNING SOLID MATERIAL ADVANTAGES BY THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0122 AND THE DESIRABLENESS OF LIMITING THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC METHODS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0123 OF INQUIRY TO THAT FIELD BACON'S YOUNGER CONTEMPORARY HOBBES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0124 CASTING ASIDE THE PRUDENT RESERVE OF HIS PREDECESSOR
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0125 IN REGARD TO THOSE MATTERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0126 ABOUT WHICH THE CROWN OR THE CHURCH MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY EXTENDED SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF INQUIRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0127 TO THE PHENOMENA OF MIND AND THE PROBLEMS OF SOCIAL ORGANISATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0128 WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE INDICATED THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE PROVINCE OF REAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0129 AND THAT OF IMAGINARY KNOWLEDGE THE PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE LEVIATHAN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0130 EMBODY A COHERENT SYSTEM OF PURELY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0131 IN LANGUAGE WHICH IS A MODEL OF CLEAR AND VIGOROUS ENGLISH STYLE AT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0132 THE SAME TIME IN FRANCE A MAN OF FAR GREATER SCIENTIFIC CAPACITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0133 THAN EITHER BACON OR HOBBES RENE DESCARTES NOT ONLY IN HIS IMMORTAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0134 DISCOURS DE LA METHODE AND ELSEWHERE WENT DOWN TO THE FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0135 BUT IN HIS PRINCIPES DE PHILOSOPHIE INDICATED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0136 WHERE THE GOAL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE REALLY LAY HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0137 DESCARTES WAS AN EMINENT MATHEMATICIAN AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE BENT OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0138 HIS MIND LED HIM TO OVERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF DEDUCTIVE REASONING FROM GENERAL PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0139 AS MUCH AS BACON HAD UNDERESTIMATED IT THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0140 HAS BEEN EFFECTED NEITHER BY BACONIANS NOR BY CARTESIANS AS SUCH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0141 BUT BY MEN LIKE GALILEO AND HARVEY BOYLE AND NEWTON WHO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0142 WOULD HAVE DONE THEIR WORK JUST AS WELL IF NEITHER BACON NOR DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0143 HAD EVER PROPOUNDED THEIR VIEWS RESPECTING THE MANNER IN WHICH SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0144 SHOULD BE PURSUED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0145a THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE DURING THE FIRST CENTURY AFTER BACON'S DEATH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0145b BY MEANS VERIFIED HIS SANGUINE PREDICTION OF THE FRUITS WHICH IT WOULD YIELD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0146 FOR THOUGH THE REVIVED AND RENEWED STUDY OF NATURE HAD SPREAD AND GROWN TO AN EXTENT WHICH SURPASSED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0147 REASONABLE EXPECTATION THE PRACTICAL RESULTS THE GOOD TO MEN'S ESTATE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0148 WERE AT FIRST BY NO MEANS APPARENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0149a SIXTY YEARS AFTER BACON'S DEATH NEWTON HAD CROWNED THE LONG LABORS OF THE ASTRONOMERS AND THE PHYSICISTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0149b BY COORDINATING THE PHENOMENA OF SOLAR MOTION THROUGHOUT THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0150 INTO ONE VAST SYSTEM BUT THE PRINCIPIA HELPED NO MAN TO EITHER WEALTH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0151 OR COMFORT DESCARTES NEWTON AND LEIBNITZ
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0152 HAD OPENED UP NEW WORLDS TO THE MATHEMATICIAN BUT THE ACQUISITIONS OF THEIR GENIUS ENRICHED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0153 ONLY MAN'S IDEAL ESTATE DESCARTES HAD LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF RATIONAL COSMOGONY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0154 AND OF PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY BOYLE HAD PRODUCED MODELS OF EXPERIMENTATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0155 IN VARIOUS BRANCHES OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY PASCAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0156 AND TORRICELLI HAD WEIGHED THE AIR MALPIGHI AND GREW
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0157 RAY AND WILLOUGHBY HAD DONE WORK OF NO LESS IMPORTANCE IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0158 BUT WEAVING AND SPINNING WERE CARRIED ON WITH THE OLD APPLIANCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0159 NOBODY COULD TRAVEL FASTER BY SEA OR BY LAND THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS TIME IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0160 AND KING GEORGE COULD SEND A MESSAGE FROM LONDON TO YORK
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0161 NO FASTER THAN KING JOHN MIGHT HAVE DONE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0162 METALS WERE WORKED FROM THEIR ORES BY IMMEMORIAL RULE OF THUMB
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0163 AND THE CENTRE OF THE IRON TRADE OF THESE ISLANDS WAS STILL AMONG THE OAK FORESTS OF SUSSEX
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0164 THE UTMOST SKILL OF OUR MECHANICIANS DID NOT GET BEYOND THE PRODUCTION OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0165 A COARSE WATCH THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS ILLUSTRATED BY A
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0166 HOST OF GREAT NAMES IN SCIENCE ENGLISH FRENCH GERMAN AND ITALIAN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0167 ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELDS OF CHEMISTRY GEOLOGY AND BIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0168 BUT THIS DEEPENING AND BROADENING OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE PRODUCED NEXT TO NO IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL BENEFITS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0169 EVEN IF AT THIS TIME FRANCIS BACON COULD HAVE RETURNED TO THE SCENE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0170 OF HIS GREATNESS AND OF HIS LITTLENESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0171 HE MUST HAVE REGARDED THE PHILOSOPHIC WORLD WHICH PRAISED AND DISREGARDED HIS PRECEPTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0172 WITH GREAT DISFAVOR IF GHOSTS ARE CONSISTENT HE WOULD HAVE SAID
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0173 THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL WASTING THEIR TIME JUST AS GILBERT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0174 AND KEPLER AND GALILEO AND MY WORTHY PHYSICIAN HARVEY DID IN MY DAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0175 WHERE ARE THE FRUITS OF THE RESTORATION OF SCIENCE WHICH I PROMISED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0176 THIS ACCUMULATION OF BARE KNOWLEDGE IS ALL VERY WELL BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0177 CUI BONO NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE IS DOING WHAT I TOLD HIM SPECIALLY TO DO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0178 AND SEEKING THAT SECRET OF THE CAUSE OF FORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0179 WHICH WILL ENABLE MEN TO DEAL AT WILL WITH MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0180 AND SUPERINDUCE NEW NATURES UPON THE OLD FOUNDATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0181 BUT A LITTLE LATER THAT GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE BEYOND IMAGINABLE UTILITARIAN ENDS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0182 WHICH IS THE CONDITION PRECEDENT OF ITS PRACTICAL UTILITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0183 BEGAN TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0184 UPON PRACTICAL LIFE AND THE OPERATION OF THAT PART OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0185 WE CALL HUMAN UPON THE REST BEGAN TO CREATE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0186 NOT NEW NATURES IN BACON'S SENSE BUT A NEW NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0187 THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH IS DEPENDENT UPON MEN'S EFFORTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0188 WHICH IS SUBSERVIENT TO THEIR WANTS AND WHICH WOULD DISAPPEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0189 IF MAN'S SHAPING AND GUIDING HAND WERE WITHDRAWN EVERY MECHANICAL ARTIFICE

knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0192 IS A PART OF THE NEW NATURE CREATED BY SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0193 WITHOUT IT THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS OF MODERN EUROPE AND AMERICA
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0194 MUST RETAIN THEIR PRIMITIVE SPARSELY INHABITED AGRICULTURAL OR PASTORAL CONDITION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0195 IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR WEALTH AND THE CONDITION OF OUR SAFETY FROM SUBMERGENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0196 BY ANOTHER FLOOD OF BARBAROUS HORDES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0197 IT IS THE BOND WHICH UNITES INTO A SOLID POLITICAL WHOLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0198 REGIONS LARGER THAN ANY EMPIRE OF ANTIQUITY IT SECURES US FROM THE RECURRENCE

knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0201 WHICH ARE NOT MERE LUXURIES BUT CONDUCE TO PHYSICAL AND MORAL WELL BEING
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0202 DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THIS NEW BIRTH OF TIME THIS NEW NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0203 BEGOTTEN BY SCIENCE UPON FACT HAS PRESSED ITSELF DAILY AND HOURLY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0204 UPON OUR ATTENTION AND HAS WORKED MIRACLES WHICH HAVE MODIFIED THE WHOLE FASHION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0205 OF OUR LIVES WHAT WONDER THEN IF THESE ASTONISHING FRUITS OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0206 ARE TOO OFTEN REGARDED BY BOTH FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0207 AS THE BE ALL AND END ALL OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0208 WHAT WONDER IF SOME EULOGISE AND OTHERS REVILE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0209 THE NEW PHILOSOPHY FOR ITS UTILITARIAN ENDS AND ITS MERELY MATERIAL TRIUMPHS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0210 IN TRUTH THE NEW PHILOSOPHY DESERVES NEITHER THE PRAISE OF ITS EULOGISTS NOR THE BLAME OF ITS SLANDERERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0211 AS I HAVE POINTED OUT ITS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0212 DISCIPLES WERE GUIDED BY NO SEARCH AFTER PRACTICAL FRUITS DURING THE GREAT PERIOD OF ITS GROWTH AND IT REACHED ADOLESCENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0213 WITHOUT BEING STIMULATED BY ANY REWARDS OF THAT NATURE

knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0215 WERE THE GREAT LIGHTS OF SCIENCE IN THE LATTER PART OF THE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0216 EIGHTEENTH AND THE FIRST DECADE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY OF HERSCHEL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0217 OF LAPLACE OF YOUNG OF FRESNEL OF OERSTED OF CAVENDISH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0218 OF LAVOISIER OF DAVY OF LAMARCK OF CUVIER OF JUSSIEU
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0219 OF DECANDOLLE OF WERNER AND OF HUTTON
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0220 SUFFICES TO INDICATE THE STRENGTH OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN THE AGE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THAT OF WHICH I HAVE TO TREAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0221 BUT OF WHICH OF THESE GREAT MEN CAN IT BE SAID
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0222 THAT THEIR LABORS WERE DIRECTED TO PRACTICAL ENDS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0223 I DO NOT CALL TO MIND EVEN AN INVENTION OF PRACTICAL UTILITY

knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0225 WERNER CERTAINLY PAID ATTENTION TO MINING AND I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN JAMES WATT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0226 BUT THOUGH SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE IMPROVEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0227 BY WHICH WATT CONVERTED THE STEAM ENGINE INVENTED LONG BEFORE HIS TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0228 INTO THE OBEDIENT SLAVE OF MAN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0229 WERE SUGGESTED AND GUIDED BY HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0230 HIS SKILL AS A PRACTICAL MECHANICIAN AND THE EFFICIENCY OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/mfc/sci0231 BOLTON'S WORKMEN HAD QUITE AS MUCH TO DO WITH THE REALISATION OF HIS PROJECTS
